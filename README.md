## python_DateTime_drill

This was a practice exercise for Python class. After 6 hours of grinding, was super stoked when this worked properly.

Scenario: The company you work for just opened two new branches, one is in New York City, the other in London.
They need a very simple program to find out if the branches are open or closed based on the current time of the Headquarters here in Portland. The hours of both branches are 9:00AM - 9:00PM in their own time zone. 
What is asked of you:
Create code that will use the current time of the Portland HQ to find out the time in the NYC & London branches, then compare that time with the branches' hours to see if they are open or closed. Print out if each of the two branches are open or closed.
